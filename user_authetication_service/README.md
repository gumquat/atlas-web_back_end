# Overview of Bycrypt usage in this project

This User Authentication Service is a secure and robust solution for managing user authentication in your application. It utilizes bcrypt for password hashing, providing an additional layer of security to protect user credentials.
Features

    - Secure Password Storage: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt, ensuring that sensitive user data is securely stored.

    - User Registration: Easily register new users with a username, email, and password.

    - Password Validation: Validate user passwords during login to ensure secure authentication.

    - Session Management: Manage user sessions securely, providing a seamless experience for authenticated users.

# Getting Started

Follow these steps to integrate the User Authentication Service into your application:

1. Installation


- bash
```
npm install bcrypt
```

2. Usage

 - javascript
```
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

// Hashing a password
const saltRounds = 10;
const plainPassword = 'user_password';

bcrypt.hash(plainPassword, saltRounds, (err, hash) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error hashing password:', err);
  } else {
    console.log('Hashed Password:', hash);
    // Store the hash in your database
  }
});

// Comparing a password during login
const hashedPasswordFromDB = 'hashed_password_from_database';

bcrypt.compare(plainPassword, hashedPasswordFromDB, (err, result) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error comparing passwords:', err);
  } else {
    if (result) {
      console.log('Password Matched - User Authenticated');
      // Allow user access
    } else {
      console.log('Password Mismatch - Authentication Failed');
      // Deny user access
    }
  }
});
```

3. Integration

Integrate the password hashing and validation logic into your user registration and login workflows. Ensure that the hashed passwords are securely stored in your database.

# README.md - Flask API Routes and HTTP Handling

This README.md document provides a guide on how to declare API routes, work with cookies, retrieve request form data, and return various HTTP status codes in a Flask web application.

## Table of Contents

1. [Declare API Routes](#declare-api-routes)
2. [Get and Set Cookies](#get-and-set-cookies)
3. [Retrieve Request Form Data](#retrieve-request-form-data)
4. [Return Various HTTP Status Codes](#return-various-http-status-codes)

## Declare API Routes

In Flask, defining API routes involves creating routes that respond to specific HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.). Follow these steps to declare API routes in your Flask app:

### Example:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/api/v1/hello', methods=['GET'])
def hello():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```

In the above example, a simple API route is defined that responds to a GET request at the '/api/v1/hello' endpoint.

## Get and Set Cookies

Working with cookies in Flask allows you to store and retrieve information on the client side. Here's how you can get and set cookies in your Flask app:

### Example:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, make_response

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/set_cookie', methods=['GET'])
def set_cookie():
    response = make_response('Cookie set!')
    response.set_cookie('user_id', '123')
    return response

@app.route('/get_cookie', methods=['GET'])
def get_cookie():
    user_id = request.cookies.get('user_id')
    return f'User ID: {user_id}'
```

In the above example, 'set_cookie' sets a cookie, and 'get_cookie' retrieves the cookie from the client's request.

## Retrieve Request Form Data

To access form data from a POST request in Flask, you can use the `request` object. Here's an example:

### Example:

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/submit_form', methods=['POST'])
def submit_form():
    username = request.form.get('username')
    password = request.form.get('password')
    return f'Username: {username}, Password: {password}'
```

In this example, the 'submit_form' route retrieves the 'username' and 'password' from the form data in a POST request.

## Return Various HTTP Status Codes

Flask allows you to return different HTTP status codes in your responses. Here's how you can do it:

### Example:

```python
from flask import Flask, abort

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/resource', methods=['GET'])
def get_resource():
    # Some condition to check
    if condition_not_met:
        abort(404)  # Return a 404 Not Found response
    return 'Resource Found!'
```

In this example, the 'get_resource' route checks a condition and returns a 404 Not Found response if the condition is not met.

Feel free to adapt and expand upon these examples based on your specific needs in your Flask application.
